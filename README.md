## 🚀 How to use

Each folder contains its own instructions — **open the folder you want and follow the guide inside** to find out where and how to apply the code.

In general, most tweaks follow this pattern:

1. Go to your Jellyfin **Admin Dashboard** in your web browser
2. Navigate to **Dashboard → General → Custom CSS** for CSS tweaks
3. Copy & paste the CSS code from the folder you want
4. For JavaScript tweaks, go to **Dashboard → General → Custom JavaScript**
5. Click **Save** and hard refresh your browser (Ctrl+Shift+R / Cmd+Shift+R)

> ⚠️ Some folders require additional plugins or scripts to be installed first — make sure to read the instructions inside each folder carefully before applying any code!
